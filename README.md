# Introduction

This repo contains a collection of datasets and example configuration
files for Beats and/or Logstash to ingest the data into Elasticsearch
and then also visualise it with Kibana.

This repo is complementary to
the
[official Elastic Examples Repo](http://github.com/elastic/examples).

Most of the datasets are from Australian institutions or relate to
Australian events.
